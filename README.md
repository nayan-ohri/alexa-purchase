**Alexa purchase prediciton **  
Prototyped a Alexa purchase system that predicts if a person is intersted in buying a product based on certain factors by Implmenting 3 models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours and Naive-Bayes classifier and achieved the best accuracy of 93% using K-NN.

Purchase of alexa depends primarily on 2 factors i.e. age group a person belongs to and minutes of music listened.
This model plots a comparison plot of accuracies achieved by the three models.

This image represents the model performance on test set when achieved through logistic regression.

Final Bar plot of accuracies of all three ML models:  
The accuracy score achieved using Logistic Regression is: 0.89.  
The accuracy score achieved using K-Nearest Neighbors is: 0.93.  
The accuracy score achieved using Naive-Bayes Classifier is: 0.9.
